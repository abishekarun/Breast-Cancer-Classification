	Abstract = {PURPOSE: In this preliminary study, recently developed unsupervised nonlinear dimension reduction (DR) and data representation techniques were applied to computer-extracted breast lesion feature spaces across three separate imaging modalities: Ultrasound (U.S.) with 1126 cases, dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with 356 cases, and full-field digital mammography with 245 cases. Two methods for nonlinear DR were explored: Laplacian eigenmaps {$[$}M. Belkin and P. Niyogi, "Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation," Neural Comput. 15, 1373-1396 (2003){$]$} and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) {$[$}L. van der Maaten and G. Hinton, "Visualizing data using t-SNE," J. Mach. Learn. Res. 9, 2579-2605 (2008){$]$}. METHODS: These methods attempt to map originally high dimensional feature spaces to more human interpretable lower dimensional spaces while preserving both local and global information. The properties of these methods as applied to breast computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) were evaluated in the context of malignancy classification performance as well as in the visual inspection of the sparseness within the two-dimensional and three-dimensional mappings. Classification performance was estimated by using the reduced dimension mapped feature output as input into both linear and nonlinear classifiers: Markov chain Monte Carlo based Bayesian artificial neural network (MCMC-BANN) and linear discriminant analysis. The new techniques were compared to previously developed breast CADx methodologies, including automatic relevance determination and linear stepwise (LSW) feature selection, as well as a linear DR method based on principal component analysis. Using ROC analysis and 0.632+bootstrap validation, 95{\%} empirical confidence intervals were computed for the each classifier's AUC performance. RESULTS: In the large U.S. data set, sample high performance results include, AUC0.632+ = 0.88 with 95{\%} empirical bootstrap interval {$[$}0.787;0.895{$]$} for 13 ARD selected features and AUC0.632+ = 0.87 with interval {$[$}0.817;0.906{$]$} for four LSW selected features compared to 4D t-SNE mapping (from the original 81D feature space) giving AUC0.632+ = 0.90 with interval {$[$}0.847;0.919{$]$}, all using the MCMC-BANN. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results appear to indicate capability for the new methods to match or exceed classification performance of current advanced breast lesion CADx algorithms. While not appropriate as a complete replacement of feature selection in CADx problems, DR techniques offer a complementary approach, which can aid elucidation of additional properties associated with the data. Specifically, the new techniques were shown to possess the added benefit of delivering sparse lower dimensional representations for visual interpretation, revealing intricate data structure of the feature space.},

This is mainly because the effectiveness of classification and recognition systems has improved in a great deal to help medical experts in diagnosing diseases. Such a disease is breast cancer, which is a very common type of cancer among woman. In this paper, breast cancer diagnosis was conducted using least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier algorithm. The robustness of the LS-SVM is examined using classification accuracy, analysis of sensitivity and specificity, k-fold cross-validation method and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 98.53\% and it is very promising compared to the previously reported classification techniques. Consequently, by LS-SVM, the obtained results show that the used method can make an effective interpretation and point out the ability of design of a new intelligent assistance diagnosis system."

	abstract = "Objectives
	Missing data imputation is an important task in cases where it is crucial to use all available data and not discard records with missing values. This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set.
	Materials and methods
	Imputation methods based on statistical techniques, e.g., mean, hot-deck and multiple imputation, and machine learning techniques, e.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organisation maps (SOM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were applied to data collected through the “El Álamo-I” project, and the results were then compared to those obtained from the listwise deletion (LD) imputation method. The database includes demographic, therapeutic and recurrence-survival information from 3679 women with operable invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 32 different hospitals belonging to the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM). The accuracies of predictions on early cancer relapse were measured using artificial neural networks (ANNs), in which different ANNs were estimated using the data sets with imputed missing values.
	Results
	The imputation methods based on machine learning algorithms outperformed imputation statistical methods in the prediction of patient outcome. Friedman’s test revealed a significant difference (p=0.0091) in the observed area under the ROC curve (AUC) values, and the pairwise comparison test showed that the AUCs for MLP, KNN and SOM were significantly higher (p=0.0053, p=0.0048 and p=0.0071, respectively) than the AUC from the LD-based prognosis model.
	Conclusion
	The methods based on machine learning techniques were the most suited for the imputation of missing values and led to a significant enhancement of prognosis accuracy compared to imputation methods based on statistical procedures."

	abstract = "Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes."

Research efforts have reported with increasing confirmation that the support vector machines (SVM) have greater accurate diagnosis ability. In this paper, breast cancer diagnosis based on a SVM-based method combined with feature selection has been proposed. Experiments have been conducted on different training-test partitions of the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The performance of the method is evaluated using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrix. The results show that the highest classification accuracy (99.51%) is obtained for the SVM model that contains five features, and this is very promising compared to the previously reported results."

The projected prospective accuracy of the system estimated by tenfold cross validation was 97%. The actual accuracy on 54 new samples (36 benign, 1 atypia, and 17 malignant) was 100%.
